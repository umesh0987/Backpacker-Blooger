		<td align="center" colspan="2"><font size="4">Pai was once a quiet market village inhabited by Shan people (ethnic Tai) whose culture is influenced by Myanmar (formerly called Burma). 
	Today, Pai primarily thrives on tourism. Mostly a hippie destination, it is filled with hot springs. Known among backpackers for its relaxed atmosphere, the town is full of cheap guesthouses, souvenir shops,
	and restaurants. In the environs of the town are spas and elephant camps. Further outside of town, there are several waterfalls and a number of natural hot springs varying in temperature from 27-39 °C . 
	Some resorts tap the hot springs and feed hot water into private bungalows and public pools. As Pai lies at the foot of the mountains, some tourists use it as a base for trekking and visiting hill tribes like Karen, Hmong, Lisu, and Lahu. 
	Another notable attraction is the town's Wednesday Market which brings large crowds of local villagers and tribal people from all around the Pai Valley. Tourists are also attracted by Shandicun village (Chinese village) located in the outskirts of the town.</td>

	<td><font size="4">Pai is a town in the Mae Hong Soon Province of northern Thailand. It sits in a valley on the banks of the Pai River. It's known for its nearby gorges, hot springs like the Tha Pai Hot Spring and waterfalls like Mo Paeng Waterfall. Downtown, food stalls and handicraft shops line Pai Walking Street. West of town lies Baan Santichon, a traditional Chinese village with clay houses and eateries serving Yunnan cuisine.
	Recently Pai has appeared on the Thailand tourist map and has received major infrastructure upgrades including an airport with several daily flights, nine (9) 7-Elevens, several small- to medium-size luxury resorts, totaling more than 350 accommodation properties several live music clubs, beer bars, and three sets of traffic lights. It has led to an influx of business investment and land speculation by both farang (Western Caucasians) and big city Thais. While some hail these changes as a new age of prosperity for Pai, others point to the loss of Pai's traditional customs and culture. </td>

Indian, Chinese, Burmese, Khmer and other Southeast Asian influences are still evident in traditional Thai culture. Buddhism, Animism and Westernization also play a significant role in shaping the modern culture.
	Thai national culture is identified differently throughout regions in Thailand where it also integrated different regional cultures such as the Lanna, Isan, including Chinese origin, Portuguese origin , Persian origin, and in the reign of King Chulalongkorn in the late 19th century, the European trend of nationalism began to insert greater influence into Thai culture. However, the promotion of civic culture reached its peak after the Siamese revolution of 1932 where a series of authoritarian regimes began to insert greater control over people's culture and lifestyles, especially under the regime of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram.</td>

	If you are feeling very active you can scramble all the way down and spend hours climbing and getting lost in nature.A favourite pastime is enjoying the sunset with a beer in hand, watching the sky change to an astonishing array of colours.
	It’s a bit of an adventurer’s playground too because some of the paths are quite skinny and sketchy, so make sure you wear good shoes if you are planning on exploring the place properly.You won’t be alone for sunset, but that just adds to the awesome atmosphere!

	There are 353 steps to reach the White Buddha, and while it might be tiring, the vistas from the top are always worth it.
	Time your trip to be at the top for sunset and you’ll quickly fall in love with the entire valley changing colours right before your eyes.
	Make sure you take water with you, and even though the temperature can be hot keep in mind that you still need to show respect to Buddha by covering up.

To reach the place of this waterfall, one must get through the forest by trekking. The hiking trail starts from the entrance of the dam and requires almost 2 hour to complete the trail. It is advised to hike during the summer as the water-level is under control and the paths are clear. Otherwise, during the rainy season, there are chances of slippery path, which may not be convenient and safe.</td>

	This crab salad is a mixture of imitation crab flakes, celery, red onion, fresh dill, lemon juice, Old Bay seasoning and mayonnaise. Everything gets mixed together in a big bowl, then you can either chill your salad, or serve it immediately.</td>

The dish is usually served in a searing hotplate.

Together with a coconut cream and red curry base, the dish is usually served in a coconut shell.
	Fish custard is a custard that is actually flavoured with, or contains, fish. It is therefore a savoury dish. In reality, the Doctor ate what would be better termed "fish fingers and custard", a term which he has used — but he has also called the dish "fish custard" for short.</td>

Watch out for the bone when you dig in.
	Whiting fish is a good source of vitamin B, magnesium and protein, according to the NOAA. Each 100-gram serving of whiting (the size of a standard filet) is 90 calories and contains roughly 18 grams of protein with about 1 gram of fat, making this a healthy lean protein choice.</td>
