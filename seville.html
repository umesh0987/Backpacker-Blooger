Seville has a municipal population of about 685,000 as of 2021, and a metropolitan population of about 1.5 million, making it the largest city in Andalusia, the fourth-largest city in Spain and the 26th most populous municipality in the European Union.

	<td><font face="times new roman" size="4">Seville was founded as the Roman city of Hispalis. Known as Ishbiliyah after the Islamic conquest in 711, Seville became the centre of the independent Taifa of Seville following the collapse of the Caliphate of Córdoba in the early 11th century; later it was ruled by Almoravids and Almohads until being incorporated to the Crown of Castile in 1248. Owing to its role as gateway of the Spanish Empire's trans-atlantic trade, managed from the Casa de Contratación, Seville became one of largest cities in Western Europe in the 16th century. Coinciding with the Baroque period, the 17th century in Seville represented the most brilliant flowering of the city's culture; then began a gradual economic and demographic decline as silting in the Guadalquivir forced the trade monopoly to relocate to the nearby port of Cádiz.
	Hisbaal is the oldest name for Seville. It appears to have originated during the Phoenician colonisation of the Tartessian culture in south-western Iberia and it refers to the god Baal. The city is sometimes referred to as the "Pearl of Andalusia".The most important art collection of Seville is the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville. It was established in 1835 in the former Convent of La Merced. It holds many masterworks by Murillo, Pacheco, Zurbarán, Valdés Leal, and others masters of the Baroque Sevillian School, containing also Flemish paintings of the 15th and 16th centuries.</td>

And, if you have already planned your trip, or you are in the city, we offer you a unique opportunity to know flamenco the way we do the Sevillians.The tablaos have occupied for decades a privileged place in the history of flamenco. They are meeting points between professionals, amateurs and flamenco critics. Places where the foundations and roots of flamenco art are found.
	In the tablaos flamencos they have learned and they have gained great part of their fame the most prestigious flamenco singers, dancers and guitarists. All this, of course, with the peculiarity of being enclaves where the family atmosphere and cozy reigns.
	Therefore, we could not imagine a better place in which to schedule these shows than in a tablao flamenco.
