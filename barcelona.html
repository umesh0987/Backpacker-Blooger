It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, and bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which is 512 metres (1,680 feet) high.</td>

 During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona.Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Arab domination by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. </td>

	<td><font face="times new roman" size="4">Every region in Spain has traditions to call their own, and the traditions of Barcelona and Catalonia can sometimes be surprising!
	While every place in the world—and especially in Spain—has its own traditions that might sometimes seem a bit odd to outsiders, it seems like here in Catalonia we really do have our fair share. While some are simpler—think folkloric dance and festivals—some of them definitely could also fall into the weird and wonderful variety. Read about the age-old and sometimes quirky traditions of Barcelona!. One of Barcelona and Catalonia’s most famous traditions involves a group of people, children included, climbing on top of each other to make human castles. Castellers, as they’re known, practice this official sport on any given weekend, holiday or festival throughout the year, and they can get up to eight, nine, even ten layers high! The most dazzling part? The small child who crawls to the top! Take a look at these terrific guys in action in the video below!
 	Gegants, or giants, play an important role in Catalan tradition and folklore. Usually representing neighborhood characters like the butcher, baker or fisherman, the giants parade around during festivals and also many special city events. There are hundreds of different characters, each one belonging to a different district or neighborhood of the city, and their twirling dance will be sure to impress!</td>

Downstairs, a courtyard and Gothic archways lead into white studios that illuminate his works. Upstairs, the rooms are lavish: epic painted ceilings that almost drip crystal chandeliers. Visitors flock here to see Picasso's work, but the special setting is why they come back again and again. If you’re expecting Picasso’s big-hitters, you might be disappointed—for a few minutes. Guernica resides in the Reina Sofía in Madrid, The Weeping Woman at London’s Tate Modern. What Barcelona’s museum has,
	 is everything around those postcard images. In chronological order, it shows every brushstroke (all 4,251 works’ worth) of how he moved from a classically trained painter (see Ciencia y Caridad in Room 3) to a Cubist pioneer, plus some things we never knew he did, like ceramics.</td>

The free ticket gets you into the park, but not into the best parts. For that you need a Monumental Cove ticket. Know that you need to book in advance online, and arrive promptly for your allotted slot—there’s zero wiggle room with timing.

To predict your next question: But is it La Rambla or Las Ramblas? Well, it’s really both. Originally, the area consisted of five mini-ramblas: Rambla de Canaletes, Estudis, Sant Josep, Caputxins, and Santa Mònica, but they're often lumped together and today, the street sign says La Rambla. Annoying as it is to keep your purse clenched from pickpockets for a mile, La Rambla has a charm that keeps the 78 million coming.</td>

Exposition over, the pavilion was duly dismantled back to Germany. It was only in the decades after—cue: a face-palming moment of hindsight—that the architectural community realized just how pivotal Mies van der Rohe’s founding symbol of modernist architecture was. In 1980, Barcelona City Council enlisted a team of Catalan architects to turn salvaged photographs and drawings into a delicate, atmospheric reconstruction. Most people’s overarching takeaway from the Pavilion is that it’s smaller than they imagined, so use this as your battery recharge before tackling the other arty big-hitters on Montjuïc, such as Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC) and Fundació Joan Miró.

It looks like a palace; the water feature in front is even called the Magic Fountain. (Come at night, Thursday to Saturday, for a water-light spectacular; during the summer, from June 1 through September 30, it's Wednesday to Sunday). So far, we’ve described about 400 meters of Montjüic: the rest has more museums, the 1992 Olympic site, exotic gardens, and enough panoramic views to jam a smartphone camera roll.

The restaurant is stylish and modern, with exposed brick, bare wood, and stone tiles that blur the line between the city street outside and the interior of the dining room, separated solely by a huge wall of glass. The food has clear Spanish roots, but also strays north and west, with Provençal pate and burrata with black truffle. Dishes like the ortiguillas (sea anemone) omelet and delicate semi-cured dorada (gilt head bream) with grapes and almonds are superb modern takes on Spanish classics, and the service is as informal as possible to avoid pretension while still offering a refined culinary experience.</td>
