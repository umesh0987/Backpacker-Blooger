The Balearic Islands have been an autonomous region of Spain since 1983. There are two small islands off the coast of Mallorca: Cabrera (southeast of Palma) and Dragonera (west of Palma). The anthem of Mallorca is "La Balanguera".
	Like the other Balearic Islands of Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera, the island is an extremely popular holiday destination, particularly for tourists from Germany and the United Kingdom. The international airport, Palma de Mallorca Airport, is one of the busiest in Spain; it was used by 28 million passengers in 2017, with use increasing every year since 2012. The Cultural Landscape of the Serra de Tramuntana was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.Archudke Ludwig Salvator of Austria was the architect of tourism in the Balearic Islands. He first arrived on the island in 1867, travelling under his title "Count of Neuendorf". He later settled in Mallorca, buying up wild areas of land in order to preserve and enjoy them. Nowadays, a number of trekking routes are named after him.French writer Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (pseudonym: George Sand), at that time in a relationship with Chopin, described her stay in Mallorca in A Winter in Majorca, published in 1855. Other famous writers used Mallorca as the setting for their works. While on the island, the Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío started writing the novel El oro de Mallorca, and wrote several poems, such as La isla de oro.</td>

Mallorca’s biggest annual festival is a two-week celebration of the city’s patron saint, bringing everyone together for a week of bonfires, shared meals, live performances and traditional dancing.The festival begins with a procession of fire breathers and drummers through Palma’s packed streets, young and old coming together to witness a centuries-old spectacle. Plaça Major town square comes alive with traditional dancing and folk music, while the square surrounding the town hall holds hundreds of bodies swaying to electronic music.Palma’s Passeig de Born is transformed into a rock concert, and crowds gather throughout the cobbled streets around sound systems pumping electro swing. Each neighbourhood has its own bonfires and torada (pork barbecues) on which to cook sobrassada, botifarró and chops.There’s plenty to fill a weekend in Palma before we even get to the city’s up-and-coming Portixol and Molinar neighbourhoods. Something to look forward to on another visit to the Majorcan capital, one of the Mediterranean’s most underrated cities of culture.

Visitors are awed by the 6,600-square-meter interior of the cathedral with its aisled nave rising to a height of 44 meters.
	Splendid stained-glass windows including several rose windows (the largest dates from 1370) illuminate the sanctuary with an ethereal glow. Much of the interior was remodeled by famous Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí in the early 20th century. </td>

	The town lies a distance from the sea and was fortified to protect against pirates that were a danger during the Middle Ages. Of the ancient ramparts, only the Xara and Palma gates and the Renaissance-era Bastion of Sant Ferran remain. Alcúdia has a distinct Old World ambience with it winding medieval streets and palatial Renaissance houses.
	Important churches include Santa Ana and Sant Jaume and the Baroque chapel of Sant Crist with a 15th-century image of Christ. Alcúdia also has archaeological sites as the town was built on the site of an ancient Roman settlement. Remains of Roman houses, a forum, and an amphitheater lie to the south of Sant Jaume Church.</td>

And the rest as they say, is history. Tapas is a quintessential part of Spanish food and it can be found all over the country, including Mallorca.
