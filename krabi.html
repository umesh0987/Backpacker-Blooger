Only Bangkok, Phuket, Chonburi, and Chiang Mai earn more from tourism. Arrivals are concentrated from November to April. The crush of high-season visitors has come at considerable cost to the environment. Local authorities have devised a program, "Krabi 365 Days" to move some high-season visitors to the off-season, from May to October, called the "green season" by tourism officials, partly due to the seasonal rains. Tourism revenue has grown at an average of eight percent annually. In 2018, tourism income is expected to hit 100 billion baht, up from 96 billion in 2017. The top visitors are Chinese and Malaysians. Scandinavians number in the top five visiting nationalities. According to the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) as of 2018 there are 460 hotels in the province, with some 200 additional hotels in the process of being licensed and another 200 in the preliminary stages of consideration.</td>

With attractions including hot springs, a wildlife sanctuary, sea caves, flourishing coral reefs and exotic marine life, limestone cliffs that draw rock climbing enthusiasts from around the world, and national parks that include the island paradises of Koh Phi Phi and Koh Lanta, one could easily spend weeks in Krabi and leave yearning for more.
“Town” to most visitors is Ao Nang, a seaside strip of guesthouses, hotels, restaurants, and Souvenir shops that continues to grow as tourist arrivals increase, now spreading north into Noppharat Thara, whose quiet . Ao Nang is the major launching point for Boat trips to nearby islands and the isolated beaches of Phra Nang Cape, where the famous former hippie enclave of Railey Beach is located.<td>

	<td><font size="5">Thai culture is predominantly an Indian culture, though many inhabitants of Krabi are descended from Chinese immigrants. While Buddhism defines much of Thailand's culture overall, Krabi is an eclectic mix of Muslim, Buddhist, and Chinese-Thai influences, with a small number of gypsies. Krabi's citizens celebrate a number of Chinese holidays and its Muslim population observes its share of rituals.  
	The culture may seem, to the outsider, contradictory at times. While overall, there is an unstated mutual respect based on Buddhist traditions, partiality is shown to different sets at different times. For example, the elderly are generally deferred to, except in the presense of a monk, in which case, the monk is favored. So, status more than age is the standard adhered to. Women are generally on the lower rungs in regard to societal rank.Agriculture plays a large part in Krabi society, which is predominantly rural. Originally, Krabi was established as a source of elephants for  nearby Bangkok. Rubber, coconut, and pineapple plantations eventually covered much of the surrounding area, and was Krabi's major industry long before tourism. </td>

Apart from its few long-tailed boats and scanty bars, the island is secluded. This is also one of the best Krabi attractions one must visit.
