		<td align="center" colspan="2"><font size="4">Sukhothai, town and historical capital of a former kingdom of north-central Thailand. It is one of Thailand’s earliest and most important historical settlements. Originally a provincial town within the Angkor-based Khmer empire, Sukhothai in the 13th century gained its independence and became established as the capital of the first united and independent Tai state in what is now Thailand’s Chao Phraya River basin, or Central Plain. The kingdom’s third ruler, King Ramkhamhaeng (reigned c. 1279–c. 1298), extended Sukhothai’s hegemony north into what is now Laos, west to the Andaman Sea, and south onto the Malay Peninsula. The ancient town is reported to have had some 80,000 inhabitants. Its architectural development began under Ramkhamhaeng and reached its peak in the latter part of the 14th century, when most of Sukhothai’s monasteries were built. After 1351, when Ayutthaya was founded as the capital of a powerful rival Tai dynasty, Su	kho	thai’s imperial influence began to wane, and in 1438 the town was conquered and incorporated into the Ayutthaya kingdom. Sukhothai is thought to have been abandoned in the late 15th or early 16th century.</td>

	<td><font size="4">Sukhothai was a town founded in the 13th century on the fringe of the Khmer empire. The exact year is unknown, but according to the Fine Arts Office it was between 1238 and 1257. Founded by Phokhun Si Intharathit, it was the first truly independent Thai (Siamese) Kingdom after defeating the Khmers. Sukhothai enjoyed a golden age under their third king, King Ramkhamhaeng, who was credited with creating the Khmer-derived Thai alphabet which is essentially the same as that in use today.He also laid the foundation for politics, the monarchy and religion, as well as expanding its circle of influence. Sukhothai was later ruled by many kings. The province is most known for the historic city of Sukhothai, the capital of the Sukhothai Kingdom. It is about 12 km from the modern New Sukhothai city. Not far from Sukhothai are the Si Satchanalai Historical Park and the Kamphaeng Phet Historical Park. Both were cities in the former Sukhothai kingdom and at the same time period.</	</td>

He also tasked the monks of Tambralinga with spreading the Theravada Buddhism throughout Sukhothai. This encouraged the development of a new written alphabet. Thus, Ramkamhaeng is credited with the invention of the Thai script.
The Sukhothai Kingdom was also heavily influenced by its eventual relationship with the Yuan Dynasty. The Yuan dynasty was an empire of China. Much of the works that were created in Sukhothai at this time had a Chinese influence on style.</td>

Nearly 200 temples were excavated and partly reconstructed here, providing visitors with a chance to get a unique look at what Thailand's early capital might have been like.
	In the city's heyday, three earthen walls and two moats surrounded the old center. Twenty-one wats and four ponds were uncovered during excavations. This was the cradle of Thai culture, and archaeologists have found the remnants of artistic and religious works that would define a society for centuries.
	Foreign visitors will find here an information center detailing Sukhothai activities and self-guided tours, plus display boards in English outside every building.</td>

	The flat relief on the southern side shows Buddha, striding over steps. Protected by two parasols, Buddha is accompanied by the Hindu goddesses Indra and Brahma, as well as by worshippers. This is assumed to be the first visual representation of a stepping Buddha from the Sukhothai period.

I went with OR Shop just in front of the historical park and I rented a bike for a day for 30 THB. Once you have your bike, go and buy the ticket to enter the historical park.
	You will have to pay for the entrance fee as well as for the bike which should cost 100 THB (20 THB for Thais) plus 10 THB respectively. Once you got your ticket from the ticket booth, enter the park and head towards Wat Maha That, the largest ruin complex in the park just west from the gate.</td>

This hugely popular local eatery is located on the twelve kilometres road that connects New Sukhothai with Old Sukhothai, so it’s a little bit difficult to reach if you don’t have your transportation. But we can assure you that it’s worth the trip. The noodle soup at Ta Puy Noodle has a distinctive red colour and is deliciously flavoured. Sukhothai Noodles are slightly sweeter and sourer than standard Thai noodles and are served with green beans and thinly sliced roasted pork. There are a handful of other food options available at Ta Puy as well, such as Pad Thai, Satay and Sukhothai Noodles Dry, however, the main attraction is the Sukhothai Noodle Soup </td>

But we are here to help you to find exciting dishes, so we recommend you to order the Pad Pad Pla (140 THB), which is authentically spiced and packed with flavours.

Khao Moo Grob is a Chinese-influenced Thai dish that is made with crispy pork and covered in a thick, sweet gravy. The restaurant is open at 5:30 in the morning and from that moment on, hungry locals keep coming in.

	British-born animal activist Katherine Connor founded Boon Lott's Elephant Sanctuary (BLES) to give elephants rescued from the tourist and logging trades a place to call home. Located not far outside the historical city of Sukhothai, BLES is a 540-acre animal reserve where things are done on "elephants' time."
	There are no tours here or organized activities. Instead, visitors get to immerse themselves in a participative experience, walking the elephants to the grazing area or to swim in the river, helping plant or clear vegetation, and hiking with the mahouts to bring "wandering" elephants back from release sites and into the sanctuary.</td>
